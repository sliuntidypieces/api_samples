# api_samples

This is a sample api that was created when I was in University by using jpa and springboot.

As a Data Enginner, recently Webflux&RouterFuntion has been a normal option to build api interface respecting to large data volumn. This is because Mono and Flux are able to request data faster than block processing and less overhead(reactive streaming). DBs are using Tranditional relation Database like Mysql(small size of data), and distributed Data Store like ElasticSearch which can provide high efficienct query response(related data partitioning(shard), data model design, data formate...). We can discuss those techs and data storeage tricks further if having a chance. Thanks!
